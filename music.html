                        world of new possibilities in my computer graphics job. I also love the parallels of this
                        technology with the human brain, its abilities in the scientific domain (like protein folding)
                        and the crazy philosophical questions ChatGPT raises about intelligence and consciousness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other side, I really despise the <a

                            Coca-Cola</a>. When used as the single tool to produce art, I think it kills most of the
                        fun. Creating a complete music or artwork with only a few words of prompt means that 99% of the
                        artistic choices are filled by the AI. And on the ethical part, the ability to copy a person's
                        style sounds like pure theft, and the environmental impact is catastrophic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would personally vote for a complete ban on fully AI-generated art. <br>
                        I think there could be awesome creative tools to do with generative AI. A few lines of prompt is
                        just not the way to go. It's a good interface for conversational agents like ChatGPT, but
                        artistic tools should give more control and involvement to the artist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now let's talk about my personal art.<br>
                        I did use a bit of generative AI here and there. Four of the last songs I made have a cover
                        artwork partly generated by AI. I make zero money from my music and have very few listeners, so
                        I'm used to copy-paste artworksfrom Pinterest of Google Images. This is not great, and I'm
                        considering other ways as I'm getting more listeners recently. <br>
                        For the tracks <i>MADRUGADA</i>, <i>HAHAHA</i> and <i>NO MEIO PANCADÃO</i>, I found the base of
                        the artwork on Pinterest, which is entirely flooded with AI now. I did some edits on top of that
                        with GIMP (copping, color grading, text, effects...). And for the artwork of the track <i>Quebra
                            No Funk</i>, I commissioned a guy on Fiverr who used AI, although he did bring his own touch
                        with Photoshop.<br>
                        I'm also considering experimenting with AI-generated samples, but I don't like the idea of
                        giving money to companies like Suno. My mind is not made up yet.

                <h2>Some thoughts about Brazilian Phonk</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="full-text">
                <p>I recently discovered the "Brazilian Phonk" sub-genre, which mix recent phonk saturation and synth
                    with baile funk's vocals and rythm.
                    I completely fell in love with it. And I'm not te only one, it's getting super popular on Tiktok and
                    Spotify. <br>
                    The first contact is often made through gymbro content, and yes it's a perfect match. That distorded
                    aggressivity, cryptic darkness, always mixed with a bit of fun and dance.
                    I was getting tired of my metal workout playlist, and phonk brought back the hype. <br>
                    However, what made me really addicted to it was the insane creativity this sub-genre has unveiled
                    (especially with its derivatives like Bounce Funk, Krushfunk, Space Funk, etc.).
                    There are so much young crazy-talented producers, and they produce so fast that it grows
                    exponentially.
                    One part of me loves seeing this jungle teeming with creativity, boosted by tiktok and lacking any
                    boundary, wether it's classic musical rules or even ethics.
                    They sample anything, go crazy on the effects, reupload slowed-down versions, generate AI vocals and
                    covers... I really feel like everything is possible, and only <i>music</i> (as in, frequency coming
                    to my ears) matters. <br>
                    The other part of me is not a big fan of this algo-greedy culture... <br>
                    I did a playlist of my favorites: <a

                    And I added geeky metallic synths to fit the rick vibe.

                    I couldn't afford a pro software and didn't have the patience to learn, so I ended up animating it
                    frame by frame with PNGs on a cheap video software. Took me ages, but I'm proud of the result!

                <p>I made this track without any specific thought at first. But when it was almost finished, I realized
                    it was almost exactly timed to fit the Steins;Gate opening.
                    I really loved that anime, so I arranged it into a fanmade opening video. The dubstep parts did not
                    age well, but I still like how it turned out.

                <p>The first track I uploaded on SoundCloud. I was pretty proud of this one, it sounded more "pro" than
                    my
                    previous experiments.
                    The drop was inspired by a youtube video (can't find it now), which helped a lot. <br>
                    I think it took me several months to finish it. It was so laborious for me back then!
